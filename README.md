# My Dotfiles
This repository contains my config files and some scripts to help me out (mainly for debian based systems).

* Clone the repository in your home folder
```bash
cd ~/
git clone https://github.com/lukasvdberk/dotfiles/ dotfiles
cd dotfiles
```

Then either run setup.sh (for debian based systems) or arch-install (for off course arch based systems).
These scripts will install all necceserry packages and move the configs with GNU Stow
